To use a stored variable, use {} to reference them (case sensitive)
Example:

ask y/n "Yes or no?" for answer
say "You said: {answer}"

this stores a new variable called "answer" with the value the user types
Since it's a yes or no question (y/n) any answer given starting with 'Y' will be TRUE, anything else and it's FALSE

download {URL} into {FOLDER|FILE}
run {BATCH COMMAND}
execute {SYSTEM COMMAND}
say {MESSAGE}
ask [y/n] {MESSAGE} for {VARIABLE}
move|copy {FILE(s)|everything} from {FOLDER} into {FOLDER}
save {VAR(s)|everything} to {FILE}
open {FILE}
browse {DIRECTORY}
if {VARIABLE} is [not] {TRUE|FALSE|OBJECT} then {COMMAND}
- if readEula is true then move everything from bin into C:\ProgramFiles\MyProgram\bin
- if accepted is not true then ask "Why haven't you accepted yet"
