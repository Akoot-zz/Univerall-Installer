To store a variable, use REMEMBER
Example:
remember, path is "C:\path\to\file"
remember name is MyProgram

To use a stored variable, use {} to reference them (case sensitive)
Example:

ask y/n "Yes or no?" for answer
say "You said: {answer}"

this stores a new variable called "answer" with the value the user types
Since it's a yes or no question (y/n) any answer given starting with 'Y' will be TRUE, anything else and it's FALSE
if y/n wasn't put in, the variable will be stored as is

To check if a variable is something, use {} to reference them using IF
Example:
if {answer} is true then download http://somesite.io/program/to/download.exe

if {name} is Akoot then say "Hey, that's my name!"

download {URL} into {FOLDER|FILE} [loudly]
run {SYSTEM COMMAND}
say {MESSAGE}
ask {MESSAGE} for{VARIABLE}
ask {MESSAGE} to [not] {COMMAND}
move|copy {FILE(s)|everything} from {FOLDER} into {FOLDER} [loudly]
save {VAR(s)|everything} to {FILE}
open {FILE|URL|DIRECTORY}
if {VARIABLE} is [not] {TRUE|FALSE|OBJECT} then {COMMAND}
wait [NUMBER] [seconds|milliseconds]
delete {FILE|FOLDER} [loudly]
remember {VARIABLE} is {VALUE}
write {LINE} to {FILE} [at line {LINE #}]

Examples:
download http://somesite.io/repo/thing.exe into %user.home%

run path\to\someprogram.exe -arg1 -arg2 --arg3

say "Hello World!" "This is a new line!"

ask "Would you like to delete system32?" for delete
if {delete} is true then delete C:\Windows\System32

ask "What is your name?" for name
say "Hello, {name}!"

open http://google.com
open %user.home%\Desktop
open README.txt

remember, installDir is "C:\Program Files\Program"

say "Installing bin..."
move everything from bin into {installDir}
delete bin

save installdata.txt
move installdata.txt from here into {installDir} loudly

write "hey there person" in hi.txt at line 10
write "hey there" in hi.txt

wait 10 seconds
wait 500 milliseconds
wait 1 second
wait
